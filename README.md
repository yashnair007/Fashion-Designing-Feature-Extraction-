# Fashion-Designing-Feature-Extraction-

Overview
This repository contains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) implementation designed to generate new clothing designs. The model is trained on a large dataset of clothing images and uses a deep learning approach to create unique and realistic designs. The project demonstrates the potential of GANs in the fashion industry, where AI-generated designs can inspire new fashion trends.

Features
Input: High-resolution clothing image dataset.

Model Architecture:
Generator: Creates new clothing designs from random noise vectors.
Discriminator: Differentiates between real clothing images and those generated by the model.
Training Process: Alternates between training the discriminator to distinguish between real and fake images and training the generator to create convincing images.
Output: New, AI-generated clothing designs.

Dependencies
To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas pillow matplotlib scikit-learn keras tensorflow

Dataset
Use any Clothing Dataset as preffered, the bigger the dataset, the more time it takes to train the model
Format: The dataset should contain images in .jpg format organized in subdirectories.

Usage
1. Load and Split Data
The dataset is loaded and split into training and testing sets. The load_data() function handles this process.

2. Build the GAN
The model is composed of a generator and a discriminator:

Generator: Generates new clothing designs from latent vectors.
Discriminator: Attempts to distinguish real images from those generated by the generator.

3. Train the GAN
The model is trained over a set number of iterations. During each iteration, the discriminator and generator are updated. The training process alternates between:

Training the discriminator on real and generated images.
Training the GAN (where the discriminator is frozen) to improve the generator's ability to fool the discriminator.

4. Generate and Visualize Images
After training, the generator can be used to create new clothing designs. The generated images are displayed using plot_images() and plot_image() functions.

5. Example Commands
To train the GAN
python your_script_name.py
To generate and visualize new designs:
Modify the code to load the trained generator and call plot_images() with the desired parameters.

Results
During training, the model's performance is printed at regular intervals. The generator produces new clothing designs that can be visualized and evaluated. The final output of the model includes a variety of AI-generated fashion items.
